### Introduction

This page was made with the intention of visualizing the state of the pandemic
in California, especially in the bay area counties. Hopefully with this
visualization my aim is to provide a clear picture of the progression of the
pandemic.

### Motivation

This website takes data directly from the State of California. It is a small
part of making it digestible for people who otherwise would not browse the CA
Open Data archive. My goal is to make the data more accessible to people and
show them the status of the pandemic.
